# Getting started

To browse this project with Visual Studio, open **dejamobile_takehome_bankapp.sln** solution. To build, click **Build** then **Build solution**. A .exe output file should be generated in /Bin/Debug (/Release in case you switched to release mode).

You can also simply press **F5** key to start debugging and automatically start the application.

**PLEASE NOT THAT without "Dejamobile backend running" all operations with this app will fail as the SDK will not manage to reach the backend. To start the backend, let's go to backend repository, follow the readme and enjoy the ride !**
